# FistedDKP

## Introduction

This is an DKP addon developed by Anaximander on the Smolderweb-US server in WoW Classic.

The goal of the addon is to be a generic DKP addon which can support:

* Multiple "Teams"
* Multiple "Tiers"
* Multiple DKP systems

## Usage

Currently, there is only 1 command, the /fdkp version command, which pings all other FDKP users in guild and reports their version.
